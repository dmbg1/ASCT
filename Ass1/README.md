## Assignment 1

### 1. Modelling Domain Analysis

For the domain analysis of the project we explored various websites containing different CVs. Through this research we developed a table representing the concepts, its explicit definitions and intrinsic and extrinsic properties, in order to better conceptualize the metamodel to be implemented.
This table can be found in the following link: [Modeling concept table](/docs/MDA.pdf).

### 2. Modelling Language Design 

For the modelling language design we used the emf framework with auxiliary OCL constraints that, in our case were mainly used to guarantee that scales didn't deviate from its possible values. 
For example language qualifications can only have the following values as inputs: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1 and C2.

The resulting metamodel diagram was the following ([Metamodel diagram link](/docs/Metamodel.pdf)):
